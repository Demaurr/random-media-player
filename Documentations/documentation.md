# Media Analyser
![Default Screen](../Screenshots/Current_Gui_Main_Screen.png)

## Overview
The Media Player and Analyser Application is a Python-based desktop application designed to play video files with various control functionalities and Analyses user engagement. 

It helps users to keep track of their watch_time while watching movies or any videos.

It provides all the typical mediaplayer features such as playing, pausing, fast forwarding, rewinding, selecting files, saving favs. The application uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the python-vlc library for video playback.

The Player Can Play Typical Media Files and Keep Stats tracking and Saving Your Favorites and Play Your Favorites in a easy and efficient way.

### Other folders and files:
- **Screenshots/**: Stores screenshots taken during video playback.
- **Documentations/**: Contains documentation files and guides.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies required to run the application.
- **Readme.md**: Main project overview and quickstart guide.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python, but may require separate installation on some systems)
- `python-vlc`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for statistics and dashboard features)
- See `requirements.txt` for the full list of dependencies

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Demaurr/random-media-player.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd random-media-player
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download and **install VLC Media Player**:
   The application uses `python-vlc`, which requires VLC Media Player to be installed on your system.  
   [Download VLC here](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).  
   > Without VLC installed, video playback will not work.

5. (Optional, for video orientation filters) 
   To use the **"V"** (vertical) and **"L"** (landscape) filter buttons, you must have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and available in your system PATH.

## Functionality

* Walk the Given Folder using `os` library and get all the media files in the directory and its sub-directory.
* Keep Track of the All The Videos Watched related Info and store it in a **csv** through `watch_history_logger.py`.
* Records the Statistics for the Current Open Session and shows stats through `video_stats.py` in a separate window.
* Generates Summary in HTML Format Through The respective Button in **"Session Statistics"** window.

## Supported Video Formats

The player supports `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.webm`, `.wmv`, `.flv`, `.mov` and `.m4v` files by default. You can add more formats in the `get_video_files` method in `videoplayer.py`.

## Session Statistics & Summary Reports

After closing the player, a session statistics window appears, showing:
- Each video watched (with folder)
- Total watch time per video
- Number of times watched
- Session duration

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Some advanced video codecs may not be supported if VLC is not installed properly.
- Large folders with thousands of videos may cause slow loading.
- Watch time is based on playback segments and may not be 100% accurate if the app is force-closed.
- Might Hang if the CPU is slow.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q:** The player doesn't start or crashes on launch.  
**A:** Ensure you have Python 3.8+, `tkinter`, and `python-vlc` installed. Also, make sure VLC media player is installed on your system.

**Q:** Videos do not play or are not found.  
**A:** Check that the folder path you provide contains supported video files and that you have permission to access them.

**Q:** Statistics or dashboard features do not work.  
**A:** Ensure `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are installed. See `requirements.txt` for all dependencies.

**Q:** VLC is installed but videos still do not play.  
**A:** Make sure VLC is added to your system PATH and is the correct architecture (32/64-bit) matching your Python installation.

**Q:** Not getting the video snippets in All Media Files
**A:** It's designed to be like that. You can find them in Category of Trimmed Videos.
