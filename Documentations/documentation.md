![Default Screen](../Screenshots/Current_Gui_Main_Screen.png)

## Overview
The Media Player and Analyser Application is a Python-based desktop application designed to play video files with various control functionalities and Analyses user engagement. 

It helps users to keep track of their watch_time while watching movies or any videos.

It provides all the typical mediaplayer features such as playing, pausing, fast forwarding, rewinding, selecting files, saving favs. The application uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the python-vlc library for video playback.

The Player Can Play Typical Media Files and Keep Stats tracking and Saving Your Favorites and Play Your Favorites in a easy and efficient way.

## Project Structure

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Demaurr/random-media-player.git
    ```

    ```bash
    cd random-media-player
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash

## Session Statistics & Summary Reports

After closing the player, a session statistics window appears, showing:
- Each video watched (with folder)
- Total watch time per video
- Number of times watched
- Session duration

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Some advanced video codecs may not be supported if VLC is not installed properly.
- Large folders with thousands of videos may cause slow loading.
- Watch time is based on playback segments and may not be 100% accurate if the app is force-closed.
- Might Hang if the CPU is slow.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q:** The player doesn't start or crashes on launch.  
**A:** Ensure you have Python 3.x, `tkinter`, and `python-vlc` installed. Also, make sure VLC media player is installed on your system.

**Q:** Videos do not play or are not found.  
**A:** Check that the folder path you provide contains supported video files and that you have permission to access them.

## Contributing

Contributions to the Media Player Application are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, or feature requests, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.

The codebase is modular. To add new features:
- Create a new module (e.g., for subtitles or playlists)
- Import and integrate it in `gui_main.py` or `videoplayer.py`
- Update the documentation and keyboard shortcuts as needed

## Future Enhancements
* Displaying properties for each media files.
* Sorting my Duration or giving the user Duration related info.
* Record Sessions info for better time management.
